      <description>Computing the Fibonacci Series We have got the computer operational again. As of right now, everything essential is working again. The IMSAI 8080 come with a input and output both addressed on port 0xFF which maps to the higher 8 bits of address and the 8 led on the top left corner of the front panel.
The first program we decided to run on the machine is to compute the fibonacci series and display them one at a time on the front panel led.</description>
