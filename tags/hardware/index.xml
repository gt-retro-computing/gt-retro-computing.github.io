      <description>This is the first [and potentially the last :( ] time I am writing for this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at the VIP for 2 semesters, and my work primarily focused on getting the IMSAI 8080 to work. Here I document my work with the Cremenco TU-ART card, and how Calvin and I tried to get it to work with a PuTTY terminal.
Background Work done previously by Calvin had led to the discovery of the FTDI interface, a way to convert USB communication to Serial communication (TTL level) and vice versa.</description>

      <title>S100 FPGA and 16550 UART</title>

      <description>It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve written on this blog. There has been quite a lot that has happened since my last update. One of the most recurring theme in this endavor on the retro computing has been constantly repairing old, unreliable circuits. Since now the focus has been slowly shifting to the software side, for the interest of providing a reliable platform for software debugging, I decided to deisng a S100 add-in card that features an FPGA.</description>

      <title>Tarbell MD1101 SSSD Floppy Controller</title>

      <description>MD1101 Our machine came with a Tarbell MD1101 Single Side Single Density (SSSD) floppy drive controller along with 2 8&amp;quot; floppy drives.
 The Tarbell Floppy Disk Interface was a programmed-data-transfer (not DMA) device utilizing Port I/O, similar for example to the SD Systems Versafloppy boards. It was designed to work with a variety of standard-size floppy disk drives. It includes a 32-byte ROM bootstrap program, which was automatically enabled when the computer RESET button was pushed, and which switched itself out after the bootstrap had run.</description>

      <title>New SIO Compatable Serial Card</title>

      <description>Although the system we have does include an original IMSAI SIO-2 card, which includes 2 RS-232 compatable serial interface. However, we are unable to get the card working reliably. (#TODO Link Post Here) While repairing the original IMSAI SIO-2 card is still in the long term plan, we decided to implement a custom and modern serial solution that emulates the IMSAI SIO-2 board with Intel 8051 USART communication interface IC.</description>

      <title>The MMU - Part 1: Design and measure</title>

      <description>Creating an Memory Management Unit for the 8080 CPU Background and Theory As part of the project goal is to get this IMSAI to run a modern operating system with preemptive multitasking capabilities. A crucial component that is currently missing is the Memory Management Unit1. Having the memory management uint allows programs to be allocated &amp;ldquo;virtual address spaces&amp;rdquo;. This is great solution for multiple programs competing for the same blocks of memory.</description>

      <title>Memory Dumper</title>

      <description>Background So we have got our first program running on the old IMSAI 8080 computer. Although the process of flipping switches to program the machine in binary was an extraordinary experience for the first few days, but very soon it got very tedious and slowing us down in the process of debugging the system.
With all the modern technology we have got, we decided to make some quick hardware that allows us to directly write the memory without manually entering each byte.</description>

      <title>Front Panel Broke Down: A Dead 74LS10</title>

      <description>Front panel repair During the process of testing the memory dumper card, we found some how the front panel is behaving weirdly.
Took quite a while for us to track down the problem, but eventually it narrowed down to a broken 74LS10 (Dual Tri-input NAND gates). Which controls the input switches.</description>

      <description>The IMSAI 8080  TLDR; this post documents the IMSAI system as we got it.
 Through the VIP program at Georgia Tech, we were able to acquire an IMSAI 8080 system to work on. Initially I had little to no knowledge about the IMSAI system. Through some quick web search we were able to find the manual for the computer and understand some history behind it.
History The IMSAI 8080 is one of the first desktop computer at the time.</description>
