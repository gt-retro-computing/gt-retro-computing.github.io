      <description>MD1101 Our machine came with a Tarbell MD1101 Single Side Single Density (SSSD) floppy drive controller along with 2 8&amp;quot; floppy drives.
 The Tarbell Floppy Disk Interface was a programmed-data-transfer (not DMA) device utilizing Port I/O, similar for example to the SD Systems Versafloppy boards. It was designed to work with a variety of standard-size floppy disk drives. It includes a 32-byte ROM bootstrap program, which was automatically enabled when the computer RESET button was pushed, and which switched itself out after the bootstrap had run.</description>
