      <description>This is the first [and potentially the last :( ] time I am writing for this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at the VIP for 2 semesters, and my work primarily focused on getting the IMSAI 8080 to work. Here I document my work with the Cremenco TU-ART card, and how Calvin and I tried to get it to work with a PuTTY terminal.
Background Work done previously by Calvin had led to the discovery of the FTDI interface, a way to convert USB communication to Serial communication (TTL level) and vice versa.</description>

      <description>It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve written on this blog. There has been quite a lot that has happened since my last update. One of the most recurring theme in this endavor on the retro computing has been constantly repairing old, unreliable circuits. Since now the focus has been slowly shifting to the software side, for the interest of providing a reliable platform for software debugging, I decided to deisng a S100 add-in card that features an FPGA.</description>
